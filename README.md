# Motion-Planning-Algorithms
This repository consists of various Motion Planning Algorithms. The purpose is to study how different algorithms work on a grid maze and view their efficiency or speed. I have considered two modes of frontier expansion: the 8 neighbor and 4 neighbor expansion.

Download the .txt files. They contain the grid maze. These files can be modified to create your own custom maze. 
  1. The file A_star.py runs the A* searching method.
  2. The files ANA_4neighbor.py and ANA_8neighbor.py run the ANA* searching method.
  
The A* program has the 4 neighbor and 8 neighbor expansion incorporated in the same file. The ANA_4neighbor.py is the ANA* file for 4 neighbor expansion and ANA_8neighbor.py is the ANA* file for the 8 neighbor expansion.
